# fullstack open 2021 submission

`main` is actually the main branch for this year submission.

`revision` is new branch for new submission, since I already forgot most of React I've learned before lol.

## Directory explanation

- Each part has its own directory, with the naming pattern of `partx`, with x being number startinf from 0.
- Exercises for each part is contained within `/exercises` folder
